# jcc -- playing around with compiler stuff
Old 2013 compiler project 

Use make pre-proc and make mini-compilo to build the compiler.

./my_nasm_gcc.sh links all the stage together and tries to compile test.c.

The mCC folder contains a derived version to examine 3-address code production of the compiler.
